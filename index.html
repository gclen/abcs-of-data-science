# Introduction

ABCs of data science is intended for anyone who wants to learn more about data science, regardless of skill level. It aims to give readers
a high level overview of various data science concepts, so that they can explore these topics further. 

Below is a list of the topics I’m planning on covering (I’ll link to them here as I write them). Please leave a comment on the blogs 
if you think I’m missing something or if there is something you want me to cover. You can also follow the ABC's of data science
