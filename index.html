# Introduction

A few years ago I wrote a series of blogs giving a crash course on some basic data science concepts. 
I really enjoyed writing them and people seemed to enjoy them/find them useful. I had an idea for a similar blogging 
project I’m calling “ABCs of data science” in which I write 26 blogs. I’m hoping to put one out every couple of weeks 
(though they may not be evenly distributed). The goal of this project is to dive into some concepts in more detail 
and point out how people actually use data science techniques.

By publicly announcing this project (via this blog) I’m hoping that it forces me to commit to writing all of the blogs. 
Below is a list of the topics I’m planning on covering (I’ll link to them here as I write them). Please leave a comment on the blogs 
if you think I’m missing something or if there is something you want me to cover. You can also follow the ABC's of data science
