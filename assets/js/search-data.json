            "title": "N is for Natural Language Processing (NLP)",
            "content": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a huge area within data science. It’s so huge that this blog will barely scratch the surface and will just give you a flavour of the kinds of things people try to use NLP for. As you might guess, the goal of NLP is to try and gain insights and information from language (either spoken or text). Text data can come from a wide variety of sources such as tweets, news articles, or transcripts of speech-to-text. NLP is used in a lot of applications, including . Autocorrect | Chatbots and virtual assistants (e.g. Siri or Alexa) | Language translation (e.g. Google translate) | Document summarization | Text classification (e.g. is this email spam or not?) | Sentiment analysis (e.g. is this movie review positive or negative?) | Grouping documents | . In recent years, machine learning (deep learning in particular) has become increasingly popular within NLP but there are still a number of non-ML based techniques. . Language models . If you’ve ever tried to learn a new language, you probably know that languages are hard. There are lots of weird rules (i.e. grammar) and there are even more exceptions to those rules. Language also changes depending on the context. For example, the language used in academic papers is very different from tweets. So given a corpus (the technical term for a bunch of data such as documents) we want to learn how language is used within that set of documents. A document could be a tweet, an academic paper, an email etc. It’s nearly impossible to code all of the grammatical rules ahead of time, so we try to use NLP techniques to model language as it’s used in that corpus. The goal of this is not to relearn grammar, but give a better footing for the task that we really care about (e.g. sentiment analysis). . A common practice in many NLP tasks is to use a language model which lets us learn how specific words are used in a corpus. For example, words such as “the” or “and” occur much more frequently than say “lagniappe”. To train a language model, we take a bunch of text and then try to predict the next word. If we have the sentence “I have a golden retriever and she is the best” we want to use the previous words to predict the next word. . Given “I”, predict “have” | Given [“I”, “have”], predict “a” | Given [“I”, “have”, “a”], predict “golden” | Continue until you’ve predicted the number of words in the sentence | We repeat this process and compare how our predictions match the actual text to improve the model. At the end of this we will have a predictive model for how different words are used in practice (e.g. “the” is much more likely than “pizza”). This is obviously a challenging task (and the model will often be wrong). Fortunately we can train models on huge amounts of text (e.g. wikipedia). We don’t even need extra labels since we already know what the next word is in a given sentence! In practice we can use language models that have already been trained so we don’t need to train a new language model on wikipedia for every task. Language models are typically used as the starting point for other downstream tasks such as text classification. In some cases they are used directly in applications like predictive text/autocorrect on your phone. The benefit and downside of language models is that they model how a language is used. This means that if enough people type something incorrectly it’s possible that the model will start suggesting the incorrect version. How a language model performs (which will then affect downstream task performance) is typically dependent on the amount of preprocessing done (more on that later). . Finding spam emails . Let’s imagine we want to train a model to predict if an email is spam or not spam (ham). This is an example of a text classification problem. . Regular email: . Hey, . Want to grab lunch today? There’s a new taco truck downtown that looks great :) . -Alice . Spam email: . Dear valued customer, . Your invoice is attached. In order to see your purchase history click here . Sincerely, A totally legitimate business . First we need to turn the corpus of emails into a format that our machine learning model can understand (i.e. numbers). This is called vectorization. The simplest thing we could do is to count how often each word appears in each document. Unsurprisingly, this is called count vectorization. This gives us a word-document matrix where each row corresponds to a document and each column corresponds to a word. The values in the matrix are how often each word occurred in a given document. As an example, let’s say we have the following three short emails (documents): . The boss wants the report by Friday. | Pizza half price! This Friday only! | I ordered the pizza for the party. | Our word-document matrix would look something like this (for brevity not all words are included) .   the pizza report … friday . Doc 1 | 2 | 0 | 1 | … | 1 | . Doc 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | … | 1 | . Doc 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | … | 0 | . The columns are known as the vocabulary since it is the unique set of words occurring in all documents. As you might imagine this matrix could get very big if there is a big vocabulary (and lots of documents). However, the matrix will be sparse (mostly filled with zeroes) since most words will not appear in most documents. Fortunately, computer scientists have lots of ways to deal with sparse matrices so this is not a problem in practice. . You might notice that the word columns aren’t in the same order as the words in the original documents. We call this a bag-of-words model since we throw out all word ordering. Using a bag-of-words model means that we lose some information but it’s much faster computationally and it works surprisingly well in practice. Of course there are some applications (e.g. the language models described above) where order does matter. . Count vectorization is very simple where we just count how often a word appears in a document. But how do we figure out what the words are? What if words are slightly different (e.g. “Pizza” and “pizza”)? . Preprocessing . Preprocessing is a catch-all term for anything we do to text before passing it into a model (including vectorization). You can potentially drastically improve the performance of your model by using more sophisticated preprocessing techniques. That being said, it’s often worth trying the simple things first! . Tokenization . Tokenization is where we split some text into tokens (e.g. words). Taking a sentence and splitting it into words seems simple enough right? It’s easy enough to split a sentence on spaces and then use the resulting words. There are also more sophisticated tokenization techniques which will split within words (e.g. turning #datascience into “#” and “datascience”). This is also related to chunking where you try to find the sentence boundaries in large pieces of text. How you tokenize a sentence also depends on the language. For example, a language like German which has a tendency to make new words by combining a bunch of existing words. You might want to split the new word into its original components. . Related to tokenization is the notion of n-grams. These are sequences of tokens which have n elements. For example, if we split the sentence “the dog loves treats” into bigrams (n=2) we would have . [(“the”, “dog”), (“dog”, “loves”), (“loves”, “treats”)] . This lets you capture a little more context around each word. Once we have n-grams we can just do count vectorization like we did above. Instead of columns corresponding to words (unigrams) they will correspond to n-grams. This means that our matrix is not “how often did this word appear in this document” it is “how often did this sequence of words appear in this document”. . It’s worth noting that you don’t need to have traditional language to tokenize. For example you could take file paths “/this/is/a/file/path” and split it into individual files/directories ([“this”, “is”, “a”, “file”, “path”]). Once you have tokens you can apply a wide range of NLP techniques. . Lowercasing all tokens . A really common (and easy) preprocessing step is to make everything lowercase. This means that “Friday” and “friday” are not treated as two separate tokens. . Stop word removal . Stop words are words that occur very frequently in a given language/corpus. In English these are words such as “the”, “and”, “they” (though there is no definitive list of stopwords). In many cases we want to filter out stop words since they don’t carry much information. This is more useful in tasks like text classification. In other cases such as automated translation you will need to keep stop words. . Stemming/lemmatization . Stemming and lemmatization are used to help normalize text. There are many forms of words that all have the same base. For example, “the dog barks/barked/is barking” are all semantically similar. If we are training a model (say a language model) “barks”, “barked”, “barking” will all be treated as separate tokens. To make it easier we would like to normalize all of those tokens to “bark”, giving us the sentence “the dog bark”. Stemming turns a word into its base (e.g. barked to bark), using language specific rules for removing prefixes or suffixes. However, there are many edge cases so it’s not 100% effective. This is done Lemmatization is a more sophisticated form of stemming and normalizes words into their true base (e.g. normalizing “was” to “be”). Again, this is based on language specific rules (and a bunch of lookup tables). . Minimum term/document frequency . If we keep every word that shows up in any of our documents our vocabulary size will be enormous. In order to reduce the vocabulary size, one common trick is to only keep words/tokens that only occur more than N times. For example, if there is a document that contains the token “maewpfaefamefaef” it’s pretty unlikely that it’s going to show up frequently. So we can just get rid of this by saying “don’t include words that occur less than 5 times”. Similarly, we can also drop words if they show up in less than N (e.g. 5) documents. For example, if we had a document that was “Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo” the word buffalo occurs more than 5 times. But if that was the only document that buffalo appeared in, we probably want to drop buffalo from our vocabulary. . Beyond simple counting . If we just count how often words appear in documents, there are going to be words (e.g. “the”) which occur frequently but don’t contain much information. How do we deal with the fact that some words convey more information than others? One way to do this is to weight our counts using “Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency” (TF-IDF). The intuition behind TF-IDF is as follows: . If a word appears frequently in most documents in the corpus it probably doesn’t give much information. So we should give those words less weight since they don’t mean as much. | If a word appears frequently in a small number of documents then it probably has more information. For example, the word “inheritance” might appear more often than you would expect in spam emails, but not in most normal emails. We should give these words more weight. | If a word doesn’t occur that frequently, then it doesn’t really give useful information. For example, if the word “oxymoron” occurred 10 times in our email corpus it doesn’t really help us distinguish between spam/not spam. | . In TF-IDF vectorization, we do count vectorization as we did before then apply one additional step. This extra step is just multiplying the counts by the weight of each word. Using this weighting will help our model distinguish more easily between spam and not/spam. . Summary . This was just a brief introduction to some of the concepts used in NLP. There are many things that can make NLP more complicated in practice such as dealing with multiple languages in the same corpus. NLP techniques can be a really powerful toolset to have at your disposal and they don’t just apply to traditional text data. If you have data that you can tokenize, then you can apply all of the techniques described above. If you want to dive into some NLP projects I recommend starting with this course from fast.ai. .

            "title": "M is for Munging Data",
            "content": "You might think that data scientists spend most of their time training machine learning models. In fact most of the time (60%-80%) spent on a data science project is acquiring and preparing the data. In the case of supervised learning problems this also includes getting labels. This process of preparing data is often referred to as data munging or data wrangling. Data wrangling typically includes a number of tasks: . Getting and cleaning the data | Selecting features | Engineering features | Transforming the data | . To paraphrase the bodybuilder Ronnie Coleman “everybody wants to be a data scientist but don’t nobody want to munge no ugly-ass data!”. While it isn’t the most glamorous part of data science, good data preparation is critical for having models that perform well. Properly cleaned data and good features can give better performance than trying to tweak the model itself. . Getting data . Datasets can come in a wide variety of formats but there are a few common ways of accessing them: . Spreadsheets: These are typically excel spreadsheets or CSV (comma separated value) files. These can be easily read in using something like the pandas library in python. | Web APIs: Many data sources provide an API for fetching data, and you can interact with these APIs using python’s requests module. If you need to scrape the website itself, the beautifulsoup module is extremely helpful. | Databases: Data scientists will often interact with their data in databases using SQL. | Unstructured data: All of the formats above provide data in some structured manner. Unfortunately, this is not always possible and you may need to use regular expressions and other techniques to parse the data. | . Cleaning and transforming data . When you are first looking at a new dataset it is extremely important that you look at your data! A fancier term for looking at your data is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Once you have an environment set up, what does EDA look like in practice? . Looking for missing data . Real world data is messy and there can be mistakes or missing data. You might need to infer missing values or drop rows with too much missing data. How you infer missing data depends on the data type and what works best for your problem. For example, if you have a field with missing numbers, you could fill in the missing value with the average or just put 0. You also need to check if there is a pattern to which rows/fields have missing values. If there is a pattern (i.e. it isn’t random) you will need to compensate for that as well. . Visualizing data . Data visualization is an invaluable tool when exploring data. Below are some questions that we are typically trying to answer by visualizing data . What do the feature distributions look like? This could be as simple as answering the question “Do some values occur very frequently?”. This might be answered by making a histogram of your data. | Do some features correlate with one another? For example in a census dataset, the neighbourhood someone lives in will typically correlate with household income. | Are there big patterns that jump out in the data? It might be hard to see these patterns (e.g. lots of duplicate points) when looking at a spreadsheet, but when plotted are very obvious. | . Transforming data . It is pretty common to have to tweak your data into a format that a machine learning algorithm expects. Let’s imagine we have a dataset about video games . Title Metacritic score (/100) IGN score (/10) Genre . The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild | 97 | 10 | Action-adventure | . Untitled Goose Game | 81 | 8 | Puzzle | . James Bond 007: Nightfire | 80 | 7 | First person shooter | . Here we have two numeric columns (metacritic score and IGN score) but they are on different scales. One goes from 0-100 while the other is from 0-10. Some ML algorithms assume that all of the features are on the same scale, so we would need to normalize these features. This could mean converting all the numbers so that they are between 0 and 1 (e.g. 8/10 becomes 0.8). . Many ML algorithms assume that all of your input is numeric. How do we convert the genre field (which is a categorical value) to a numeric one? One simple way to do this is known as one-hot encoding. This just means representing all categories as a vector where there is a 1 if the category matches and a 0 if it doesn’t. Using our example above we have: .   Action-adventure Puzzle First person shooter . The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild | 1 | 0 | 0 | . Untitled Goose Game | 0 | 1 | 0 | . James Bond 007: Nightfire | 0 | 0 | 1 | . So instead of having the genre value of “Puzzle” for Untitled Goose Game, we would have [0, 1, 0]. A one-hot encoding is a very simple version of an embedding. . If we have text data there are many techniques that we can use which I’ll talk about in the next blog N is for Natural Language Processing. . Common tools for EDA . Jupyter notebooks are a popular environment for doing EDA, since it provides an interactive development environment where you can see output (e.g. plots) inline with your code. The pandas module in python is very commonly used for data munging tasks and has a lot of useful utilities. I’ll talk more about the pandas library in a later blog post. . Feature selection and engineering . When preparing data for training a model you need to figure out which features in your data will be most relevant for the problem you are trying to solve (e.g. classification). There may be features that would be helpful that don’t exist in the data as it comes in. Creating new features is referred to as feature engineering. Both feature selection and engineering require some expertise in the problem domain. One way to determine useful features if you have labels is to look at the features which are strongly correlated with those labels. Imagine you are trying to predict if a file is malware or benign. If there are attributes of that file that occur frequently when the file is malware and don’t occur when it is benign, that would be a useful feature. In the case of classification, you are looking for features that make it easy to discriminate between the classes. In the case of clustering you need to choose features that say “these points are similar if they have X in common”. Feature selection/engineering is more of an art than a science and can involve some trial and error. . Summary . Data munging is a crucial part of data science (and you could argue it’s the majority of data science). Properly cleaning and normalizing your data can have huge benefits for the downstream task you are trying to solve. It is challenging and sometimes frustrating (looking at you regular expressions!) task but is necessary to understand your data and train an effective model. . Other resources .

            "title": "L is for Labelling Data",
            "content": "Having high quality labelled data is critical to training useful supervised learning models. This labelled training data needs to be directly relevant to the real world task you are trying to accomplish. Unfortunately, getting this labelled data can be very challenging in a lot of cases. This is for a couple reasons: . Labelling data is time intensive and also really boring/tedious. You often need hundreds or thousands of examples (or more!) so it takes a while to create a labelled training set. People are also incentivized/rewarded for training a useful ML model, as compared to labelling 1000s of points. | Having high quality labels often requires input from subject matter experts (whose time is valuable). For example, looking at x-ray images to label the images to have a given disease. This would require a medical professional who may not have the time required to label 1000s of images. Even if the data scientists themselves are doing the labelling, they are also typically highly paid professionals who may not have the time or commitment from management to spend hours labelling data. | Labelling data in practice . Fortunately in the real world there are a few ways to make getting a labelled data set easier (not easy, but easier). . Pay someone else to do it . There are an increasing number of services where you can outsource your data labelling tasks. This includes Amazon’s SageMaker Ground Truth or Google’s AI Platform Data Labelling Service. These services can work if you have a large budget. However, if the dataset you are trying to label is sensitive (e.g. medical records) or requires a large amount of subject matter expertise then you may not be able to use these services. Alternatively, just pay grad students to label data do research. . Make people do it for free . You’ve probably needed to go through an image based captcha (e.g. “select all the pictures with traffic lights”) in order to log into a popular web service. If you’re a large organization or have a product that many people use, this can be an effective way to get people to label data for free. . . Use pretrained models or datasets . In some cases there may be publicly available models (e.g. modelzoo) that have been trained on a similar task to the one you’re interested in. Similarly, there are publicly available labelled datasets (e.g. kaggle datasets) that you could train your own model on. These datasets/models could come from academic researchers, companies such as Google, or open source projects. If the pretrained model gives acceptable results for your problem then great! It is worth thinking about how your dataset/task is different than the one the model was trained on. If your data diverges from the original dataset over time, then your model will be less accurate. This is known as model drift. It’s possible to fine-tune these pretrained models onto your dataset/labels to improve their performance for your task. I’ll talk about that in more detail in T is for Transfer Learning. . Using unsupervised learning . Instead of labelling each point individually, you can often try clustering your data beforehand. This allows you to label groups of data instead of each individual point. . . You can build this clustering and labelling system yourself or use a labelling tool which does the same thing. Some of these include (most you need to pay for): . platform.ai for images | prodigy for text | Snorkel has a paid and a free product | . Data augmentation . One of the reasons for having large training sets is to have many examples for the model to learn patterns. If you are trying to classify images of dogs you need to have many different pictures of different breeds. The pictures need to be from different angles (head on, side view, etc.) to be able to recognize the dogs in different scenarios. One way to increase the size of your dataset is to use data augmentation. If you have a picture you can generate new labelled data by transforming the original image. This might include blurring, cropping, or rotating the image. Using this technique you can get multiple labelled data points for each image that was labelled by a human. Having multiple versions of an image with varying amounts of noise will make your model more robust as well. Data augmentation can be applied to other data types as well (e.g. text) but it’s slightly trickier than doing it with images. . . Active learning . This is a technique where you can use a ML model to help you label your data. It works as follows: . Label a small amount of your training set (e.g. 10%) | Train a ML model on the labelled data you have | Use that ML model to predict labels for the other 90%. You can verify the labels for the predictions where the model was not very confident. You should also randomly check predictions where the model was confident just to check that it is working as intended. | Using this method can help speed up the data labelling process and give you a better model overall. . Summary . Getting labelled data can be one of the most challenging parts of training a supervised learning model. If you aren’t able to throw money at the problem (most of us aren’t!) then there are many techniques you can try to increase your productivity when labelling data such as using labelling tools or data augmentation. When using existing datasets and models make sure to think about the similarities and differences between that dataset and the problem you want to tackle. .

            "title": "K is for K-fold cross-validation",
            "content": "In supervised learning problems we have data as well as a label (something we need to predict) for each data point. We typically refer to the combination of data + labels as training data. You might remember from F is for F1 score that there are two broad categories of supervised learning problems: classification and regression. In classification, we are trying to predict which class (or category) the input data belongs to. For example, this might be trying to predict if an email is spam or not spam. There are typically a small number of categories to choose from (e.g. spam/not spam). In regression problems, we are trying to predict a continuous variable (i.e. a number) such as the selling price of a house based on some features (e.g. square footage). Here we are not trying to pick from a small group of categories, but to get close to the actual number (where there can be infinitely possible values). . In all supervised learning problems we want to know well our model is doing and how well it can predict things for unseen data. . How does our model fit the data? . Lets focus on regression and take a further look at the housing example. For now assume we have a training set and some way to model our data. How do we know if our model is any good? Let’s take a look at our imaginary training data . . As you can imagine, as the square footage of a house increases the price goes up. If our model tries to fit this data with a straight line then we get something like this . . This line is an okay fit to the data but doesn’t really give accurate predictions. We say that this model underfits the data or has high bias. What we really want is a function that is much closer to all the points . . This is a pretty good fit to the data and seems to do what one would intuitively expect. The function doesn’t pass through every point but it’s pretty close to most of them. Our model could probably find some function that passes through every point . . While this function passes through every point it won’t work well on new data. We say that this model overfits the data or has high variance. This means that the model has two many parameters or there are not enough features in the training set. In this case it would probably be beneficial to add more features to the training set. For example, there is a huge difference in price between a 1000 square foot house in San Francisco versus Thunder Bay. So adding the location of the house might improve the model. In the case of the model that underfit the data, adding more features won’t help. We need to add more parameters to the model so that there is more room to try and fit the data. . Testing our model . So how do we tell if our model is any good? Typically, the training data is broken into 2 parts. There is a training set (about 70% of the data) and a test set (the remaining 30%). Splitting the data into training/test sets is known as cross-validation. As the name implies the parameters of the model are trained using the training set. The model is then fed in the data from the test set and the error is calculated. Using the error associated with both the training and the test sets you can diagnose if your model underfits, overfits, or is a good fit to the data. . In addition to using a train/test split, people will often use a third split: the validation set (sometimes called a development set). Let’s break down what each of those sets are used for: . Training set: As you would expect, this is the data used to actually train the model. As you might recall, training a model just means learning which feature weights give you the best predictions (i.e. match your labels as closely as possible). | Validation set: This is used for learning the best set of hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are knobs you can turn for the model itself (e.g. learning rate or mini-batch size). In the training set where we are trying to answer “how can I weight these features to get the best predictions?”. In the validation set we are trying to answer “how can I adjust the model itself to give the best predictions when training?” | Test set: We want to test our model on data that it has not seen in order to see if it is overfitting/underfitting. We never update the model (or hyperparameters) on the test set and we just make predictions on it using the trained model. | . K-fold cross-validation . If you split your data into training/validation/test sets using a 60/20/20 split then that means you can only use 60% of your available data for model training and the validation set is a fixed 20% of the data. In cases where you don’t have a lot of training data (which is often) this extra 20% can make a big difference! K-fold cross-validation lets you get the benefits of having a validation set without having to hold out 20% of your training data. . In k-fold cross-validation you have a training set and what I will call the true test set. This test set is exactly what is described above: unseen data used to test predictions. The k-fold part comes from taking your training set and splitting it into k groups (or folds). The value of k can be any number that you choose but as an example let’s say k is 5. You would split your training set into 5 folds and train the model 5 times. The first time you train, the first fold is used as the “test” set and the remaining 4 folds are used as a training set. The second time you train, you use the second fold as a “test” set and the other 4 folds are used as a training set. You repeat this process until you’ve used each fold as a test set. After you have fully trained the model you test your predictions on the true test set as before. This process is illustrated in the image below (taken from the wonderful scikit-learn documentation). This process can be more computationally expensive since you need to train k models instead of 1 but also means you don’t need a held out validation set. . . How do you choose a value for k? There are some different methods for choosing k since a wrong value can lead you to be overconfident in your model: . Pick k=10. This is a decent starting point (or k=5) and has been shown to work in a wide variety of applications. | Pick a value of k so that each fold gives a statistically representative sample size | Let k be the number of points you have in your training set so that each point can be used in the hold out test set. This is also referred to as leave-one-out cross-validation. | . Summary . Evaluating the performance of supervised learning models is critical and you want to be sure that your models aren’t overfitting/underfitting the training data. Cross-validation is a technique that should be used in all supervised learning applications to check that your model is behaving as expected. It is also important to keep in mind that even if your model generalizes well to the test set, it may not generalize to the real world if your training data is not truly representative. .

            "content": "In previous blogs we’ve talked about choosing a distance measure as a way of saying “these two things are close if …”. One useful measure is Jaccard similarity/distance since it measures the similarity between two sets. This is useful if you have a lot of categorical variables (i.e. ones that don’t have any inherent ordering). For example, two people are probably similar if they have the same sets of interests/hobbies. The Jaccard similarity of two sets is just the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union. Or put visually: . . Jaccard similarity/distance . As a more concrete example let’s imagine that we have collected a list of people’s favourite pizza toppings and we want to find which people are most similar. . Kara likes pepperoni, mushrooms, and green pepper | Zach likes ham, pineapple, and jalapeno peppers | Rodney also likes pepperoni, mushrooms, and green peppers | Sophie likes olives, ham, pepperoni, and mushrooms | . So what are the Jaccard similarities between these people? . Kara and Rodney like exactly the same toppings so their similarity is 1 | Rodney and Zach have nothing in common so their similarity is 0 | Kara and Sophie have some things in common but Sophie enjoys more toppings. Their similarity is 0.4 ([pepperoni, mushrooms]/[pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, ham]) | . You’ll notice that two sets that are exactly the same have a similarity of 1. To change this into a distance we just to . $D_{Jaccard} = 1 - similarity$ . Now Kara and Rodney have a distance of 0, while Rodney and Zach are a distance of 1 (which in this case is as far apart as you can be). . Hellinger distance . You might have noticed that Jaccard distance doesn’t take into account how frequently the items in the set occur. If counts do matter for your problem, then you will want to use Hellinger distance. Let’s imagine you have some data on the number of times people have read a given book: .   | Harry Potter | Hello World | The Hobbit | The Great Gatsby | Trick Mirror | . Marie | 5 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | . Jordan | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | . Sarah | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | . Patrick | 4 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | . Marie, Jordan, and Patrick have all read Harry Potter which would make them similar under Jaccard similarity. However, Marie and Patrick are probably more similar since they both read it multiple times. Hellinger distance takes this into account. I’ll try to give you some intuition for how it does this. . Imagine that each set of counts is generated by some weighted multi-sided die (that is different for each person). When we roll Maries die, it is more likely to come up with Harry Potter and less likely to come up with Hello World. The opposite is true for Sarah’s die, which is more likely to come up with Hello World and less likely to come up with Harry Potter. We calculate what the weights of these dice look like (these are called multinomial distributions). . We can then measure the mutual likelihood of these distributions. This just means “what is the probability of Jordans counts occuring using Maries die (and vice versa)”. If there is a high probability that Jordans counts occurred using Maries die, then Marie and Jordan should be considered close. If it is unlikely that Sarah’s counts occurred using Maries die, then Marie and Sarah should be pushed apart. . Hellinger distance is particularly useful if you have a bunch of text. You can consider two documents similar if you have the same words occurring at similar frequencies. . Summary . Jaccard and Hellinger are both very useful distance measures that can be used in dimension reduction and embeddings. If counts matter, use Hellinger, otherwise use Jaccard distance. .

            "title": "I is for Interpretability",
            "content": "Machine learning models are increasingly used to make decisions in everyday life, and as we’ve discussed before, they can be far from perfect. In addition to being able to appeal the decisions made by a model, it is critical to be able to interpret their predictions. Doing this in practice opens up a huge number of questions including . What does interpretability mean? | Why does it matter? | How do we actually interpret models in practice? | . Pinning down interpretability . This paper titled The Mythos of Model Interpretability by Zachary Lipton, gives a really good overview of what people mean when they say “interpretability”. He argues that interpretability is not just one monolithic concept, but a number of distinct ideas. It’s worth looking at the different reasons we try to interpret ML models. . Do we trust the model? . Using a ML model to automate some task often requires a human giving up control. We often care about the kinds of predictions the model gets wrong and if there is a pattern to these incorrect predictions. For example, many facial recognition models have significantly worse performance on people of color than white people. In this case using the model with this bias would be unacceptable. However, there may be other cases where the model gets things wrong in the same way humans do. In that case it may be acceptable to use the model to make predictions. . Can we use the model to learn something about the world? . Researchers will often look at which features of a trained model are most important in making predictions. Imagine you have a model which is trying to predict if a patient has lung cancer. As input features you have the number of years the patient has smoked cigarettes, and the number of years they have chewed bubble gum. Of course, smoking correlates much more with lung cancer than chewing bubble gum and that feature would have a much greater importance. It’s important to keep in mind that correlation does not equal causation. For example, [the per capita consumption of margarine in the US strongly correlates with the divorce rate in Maine(http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)]. Researchers can then use these important features to create experiments to test if those correlations are causal. . Will the ML model help a human make better predictions? . A common use of ML models is to help a human make a more informed decision. Imagine you work in cybersecurity and are tasked with finding malware. Fortunately, you have a ML model which determines if files are malware or benign. The important features used by the model (e.g. is the code heavily obfuscated?) can help you make a better decision in your investigation. ML models can also help you find similar examples to give you more context when triaging the file. . What do interpretable models look like? . There are two broad categories of ways to interpret models: transparency and post-hoc explanations. . Transparency . This is basically “how does the model work?”. For example, simpler models such as linear regression are considered more interpretable than a deep neural network (which is sometimes referred to as a blackbox). Let’s imagine we want to train a model to predict house prices. We could have some features about the house such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, distance to a city with more than 500 000 people etc. A linear model is just taking these features and weights and adding them up. . $ text{house price} = w_1 cdot ( text{number of bedrooms}) + w_2 cdot( text{square footage}) + w_3 cdot( text{distance to city}) + … $ . In these models a higher weight means the feature is more important so interpreting which features are more important is really easy. To say the models are interpretable overall assumes that the features themselves are also easily interpretable (e.g. number of bedrooms). . Other models may not be as easy to interpret directly. For example a random forest uses a bunch of decision trees (think flow charts). While the model may be harder to interpret overall, interpreting an individual decision tree is relatively straightforward. . Another reason that linear models are typically more interpretable than neural networks/deep learning is that we understand how they work in much more detail. For example, we can prove that a linear model will give a unique solution which is not the case with deep learning models. However, neural networks typically perform much better than other models. In order to get comparable performance out of these other models there may be tricks needed (e.g. feature engineering) which could make the model less interpretable overall. . Post-hoc interpretability . Even if we don’t directly know how the model works, we can still get useful information by interpreting the predictions. It’s worth noting that this is how humans explain decisions. We don’t always know the exact cause of a decision but can try to provide a rational explanation after the fact. Interpreting the model after the fact means that we can potentially use models with higher performance (e.g. deep learning models). . One method of post-hoc interpretability is to have an “explanation by example”. This means getting the model to predict which other examples the model thinks are most similar. In the case of predicting malware or not, the examples most similar to a malicious PDF may be other malicious PDF documents. In the case of deep learning models, we can also gain insight by visualizing the hidden layers. . Another technique that people use is to train two separate models. The first model makes the predictions, and the second model generates text that explains the prediction. For example, the first model may predict something about an image, while the second model generates a caption for that image. . Researchers may also train two separate models where one model is more interpretable than the other. For example they may train a deep neural network (with high performance but low interpretability) as well as a random forest model. While the random forest model may not perform as well, it can also give some insight into the problem space. However, this could be potentially misleading as the explanations given by the simpler model may not correspond to why the more complex model works. . Things to keep in mind . Interpretability and having explainable models is still a highly active area of research. There are a few things to keep in mind when doing this in practice . Rules of thumb such as “linear models are more interpretable than neural nets” are generally true (but not always!) | When talking about interpretability it is important to clarify what you mean exactly. I highly recommend reading Zachary Lipton’s paper for more specific definitions of the concepts above. | There may be cases where an ML model can perform significantly better than humans. Making sure the model is transparent (and potentially reducing performance) is not always the correct decision depending on the overall goal. It might be sufficient to have a better performing model with a human appeals process in place. | I recommend using existing libraries such as interpret-ml which have a wide variety of methods and examples when trying to do this in practice. | .

            "title": "H is for HDBSCAN",
            "content": "There are many data science problems where you don’t have labelled data and need to use clustering to find related points. For these clustering problems, HDBSCAN is a great algorithm. It was originally created by Campello et al. and there is a fast Python implementation written by Leland Mcinnes and John Healy. When I refer to HDBSCAN I’ll be talking about the python implementation/package. It is generally the first clustering method I try for a variety of reasons: . You don’t need to specify the number of clusters. Other clustering methods such as k-means require that you specify the number of clusters to find in your data, and this is hard to know ahead of time. HDBSCAN will find the natural number of clusters in your data. All you need to specify is the minimum number of points that a cluster should have (which is much easier to have an intuition for). | Many other clustering algorithms make assumptions about the shape of the clusters (e.g. they must fit in a circle) or they are all the same density. In real data this is generally not true and HDBSCAN finds clusters with varying shapes/densities. | HDBSCAN will label points as noise/outliers. Many clustering algorithms force every point into a cluster. However, real world data is messy and having outliers improves the quality of the clusters (since they aren’t polluted by noise). | It generally just works. I find I spend much less time fiddling with parameters and spend more time looking at my actual data. | Much of this blog is based on examples in the wonderful documentation for HDBSCAN. In particular, if you want to see how HDBSCAN compares to other clustering algorithms read this page. . Let’s look at an example . The first thing we need is an embedding, which as you might recall is just a numeric representation of your data with a way to measure distance between points. Shown below is a plot of a sample dataset. While it is an artificial dataset, it has many properties of real data: . There are a lot of noisy/outlying points which don’t belong in any cluster | The groups of points are different shapes and you can see in some clusters that the points are much closer together, while in others they are less dense. | . Let’s try clustering this data. First we import HDBSCAN and load our data . import hdbscan import numpy as np data = np.load(&#39;clusterable_data.npy&#39;) . Clustering the data is as simple as . clusterer = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=15, metric=&#39;euclidean&#39;) clusterer.fit_predict(data) . Here we are saying that there must be at least 15 points close together before we say that something is a cluster. How do we measure “close together”? We also specified a Euclidean distance metric. This is the default metric but HDBSCAN can use many other metrics. Euclidean is the default metric, but it is always better to explicitly state your distance measure for other people reading the code. If we wanted to use cosine distance instead of Euclidean (despite Euclidean being the better choice in this case) we could do . clusterer = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=15, metric=&#39;cosine&#39;) clusterer.fit_predict(data) . We can see which cluster each point belongs to using . labels = clusterer.labels_ print(labels) # [ 5 5 5 ... -1 -1 5] . The first points shown are part of cluster 5. Points that are outliers are given a label of “-1” so they are easy to filter out. Let’s remake the plot above but colour the points based on their cluster label. The outlying points (part of the -1 cluster) will be grey. . . You can see that the resulting clusters are pretty good. More importantly, they match what we would intuitively pick as the clusters if we had to draw lines around the groups of points. . Summary . HDBSCAN and its python implementation is a fast clustering algorithm that is easy to use. It naturally handles a lot of the messiness of real world data and lets you spend more time focussing on the problem you are trying to solve.

            "title": "G is for Gradient Descent",
            "content": "As I’ve said many times before AI/machine learning/deep learning is not magic. In the case of supervised learning models (including deep learning) you have four things: . Labelled data | Features (e.g. image pixels or text) | A weight for each feature (since some features are more important than others) | An objective (or cost) function which measures how well/poorly your predictions match the labels. | Before we start training a model, we have our data set and choose the features we want to use, as well as an objective function. I’ve mentioned some common objective functions in previous blog posts including cross-entropy loss and root mean squared error (RMSE). An objective function is a function of both the features as well as the weights. Once we’ve chosen the features and objective function, they are fixed while we actually train the model. This means the only thing we can change is the weight of each feature. When we refer to training a model, what we typically mean is finding which values of weights minimize or maximize the objective function. How do we actually find this set of weights? You can imagine trying a bunch of different sets of weights and seeing which gives the best model performance. However, as you might expect there are better ways to find the best set of weights. The broad category of algorithms that find the minimum/maximum values of functions are called optimization methods. . Gradient descent . Gradient descent (and related variants) is a popular optimization technique and it is widely used in a variety of applications, including basically all deep learning models. It is an iterative method, which means it keeps repeating the same steps until some criteria is reached. This stopping criteria is also referred to as convergence criteria. This stopping condition could be “stop when the value of the loss function doesn’t change from step to step”. Let’s imagine we have a simple loss function like the one shown below and our starting position is shown in red. This starting position is typically random, since our weights are randomly initialized. We want to figure out how to get to the bottom of this bowl shaped curve, since this is the set of parameters where our loss function is at the smallest value. As we iterate through this process, we are “learning” better sets of parameters (or weights). . . Imagine that you are on a hill at this red dot, and need to get to the bottom of the valley. However, you are also blindfolded (which sounds like the world’s worst escape room) so you can’t see where the valley is. You also want to get to the bottom of the hill as quickly as possible, so you want to take as few steps as possible. How would you do this? You would probably try to find the direction where the hill is the steepest and take a step in that direction. You would keep repeating this process until you got to the bottom of the hill. This is exactly what gradient descent is doing. We can calculate the direction with the steepest slope by calculating the derivative (or gradient) of the loss function. We then take a step in that direction, then keep repeating the process until we reach some stopping criteria. . The key parameter in gradient descent is called the step size or learning rate which says how far to step in the direction of the gradient. It is really important to choose this value correctly. If we choose an appropriate value (like the one shown below) we can take a reasonable number of steps (in this case 7) to get to the bottom of the hill. . . However, if we make the learning rate too small, then we need to take a lot of steps and this means that it takes much longer to get to the bottom of the hill. . . If we make it larger, then we can take fewer steps. But this also runs the risk of overshooting the minimum and even risks not converging at all. . . One way around this problem of having to choose the best learning rate is called “learning rate annealing”. Basically, it means that we start with a large learning rate (so we can quickly take large steps in the right direction). As we continue, we start taking smaller and smaller steps, so that we don’t overshoot the minimum. This has a nice balance between the large and small step sizes which makes choosing an initial learning rate less tricky. . Local vs global minima . Up until now, we have been talking about a very simple loss function which only has one minimum. In practice, loss functions are very messy and have many hills and valleys. Each valley has a local minima and there is one true global minimum which is actually the lowest point. In the loss function shown below, there are two minima. If we start at the red dot and use the method described above, we will get stuck in the valley on the right (a local minimum). However, we would like to get to the bottom of the valley on the left. . . One technique for doing this is called gradient descent with restarts. In this technique, you periodically make your learning rate very large (and then slowly make it smaller using annealing). The benefit of this technique is that the large learning rates will help you escape the local minima, and hopefully find the global minimum (or at least a good minimum). . Gradient descent in practice . In practice, there are other modifications people apply to gradient descent in order to make it faster/easier to compute. . The form of gradient descent described above is known as “batch gradient descent”. This means that the entire dataset is used to compute the gradients. For large datasets this is impractical since the entire dataset needs to fit in memory. In many applications, especially deep learning, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is used. Instead of using the entire dataset to calculate the gradient, random subsets are used (called mini-batches). While this is slightly less accurate, it is much faster and more efficient. | Momentum is a popular addition to SGD since it makes it faster to compute, and typically gives more accurate results. Here you update the weights using the gradient, but you also use a weighted average of the previous gradients. In our example about finding your way down the hill, you would not stop and try to figure out the exact best slope down the hill for each step. You would continue in roughly the same direction and make minor direction changes as needed. Momentum does a similar thing by including the history of gradients in order to speed things up. | . Summary . Gradient descent is a technique used in a wide variety of applications. In particular, it is the workhorse of deep learning, and is what is used when a model “learns” weights. It is a fairly simple idea at its core, and hopefully this gave you an intuition for how it works, as well as some techniques that are used in practice. . Other resources .

            "content": "When we are training supervised learning models, we want to measure how well the model is performing. Choosing the correct metric for measuring model performance depends on what kind of task you are doing. There are two main categories of supervised learning tasks . Classification: Here you are trying to predict which category (or categories) a piece of input data belongs to. For example, given an image you might try to predict if it is a picture of a dog or cat. | Regression: Here you are trying to predict a numerical label. For example, you might try to predict the selling price of a house given some features about it, such as neighbourhood, number of bedrooms etc. | . In this blog I’ll cover a couple of different methods for measuring model performance. First we’ll focus on classification tasks. To make this more concrete let’s imagine we are training a model to predict if a cookie contains either chocolate chips or raisins. . . The problem with accuracy . One way of measuring model performance is called classification accuracy (more commonly referred to as accuracy). This is simply “how many predictions did you get correct out of how many predictions did you make?”. If you correctly predicted the type of cookie 95 times out of 100 predictions, your accuracy would be 95%. However, accuracy only works well if the number of items in each category is roughly equal. If there are many more items in some categories than others, we call this class imbalance. For example, chocolate chip cookies are much more popular than raisin cookies in general. If we assume out of 100 random cookies that 99 of them are chocolate chip, we could get 99% accuracy by guessing chocolate chip every single time. In practice this would be a pretty terrible model, but according to accuracy this is a good model. . Building a confusion matrix . If we want to try to address this problem we can try building a confusion matrix (which is less scary/confusing than it sounds). A confusion matrix shows all of the possible combinations of predictions vs the actual labels. We need to pick one category as the “positive class” and the other as the “negative class”. This is arbitrary, so let’s pick chocolate chips as the positive class, and raisin as the negative class. There is a sample confusion matrix shown below. .   Predicted: Chocolate chip Predicted: Raisin . Actual: Chocolate chip | 120 (True Positives) | 2 (False Negatives) | . Actual: Raisin | 10 (False Positives) | 23 (True Negatives) | . I’m sure we’ve all had the experience of picking up what we thought was a chocolate chip cookie. Upon biting into it we realize “ugh, raisin”. Don’t get me wrong, I like raisin cookies but it is the mismatch between expectation and reality that is the problem. This mismatch is referred to as a false positive (FP) since we predicted the positive class, but it was actually the negative class. As you would expect, there are also false negatives (FN) where you predict raisin, but it’s actually chocolate chip. If the prediction matches the actual label, these are referred to as true positives (TP) or true negatives (TN). . Precision and recall . Precision and recall are ways of measuring classification quality. . Precision . $ text{Precision} = frac{TP}{TP + FP}$ . This is the number of true positives, divided by all of the positive results predicted by the model. In our cookie example, this means “when you predicted chocolate chip, how likely was it to actually be chocolate chip?” If we look at the confusion matrix above, the precision would be . $ text{Precision} = frac{120}{120 + 10} = 0.923$ . Recall . $ text{Recall}= frac{TP}{TP + FN}$ . This is the number of true positives, divided by all of the points that should have been classified as positive. More concretely, this is “out of all of the chocolate chip cookies, how many did you find?” . $ text{Recall} = frac{120}{120 + 2} = 0.984$ . F1 score . A model with high precision but low recall, returns few results but the predictions generally correspond to the actual labels. On the other side, a model with high recall but low precision returns many results, but most of the predictions are incorrect when compared to the labelled data. Obviously, we would like a model with both high precision and high recall. A metric called F1 score combines both precision and recall, and it is a common way to measure model performance . $F1 = 2 frac{P cdot R}{P+R}$ . An F1 score of 1.0 corresponds to perfect precision and recall and is close to zero for an extremely bad model. The F1 score is just one way of combining precision and recall, and there are other F measures which weight precision/recall differently. . Things to consider . In some problems, false positives are more important than false negatives. In others, the opposite is true. Imagine we are trying to predict if a patient has a certain disease or not. A false positive means we think they have the disease, but in actuality they are healthy. Depending on the side effects of treatment, a wrong prediction could have severe consequences. If there are major side effects to treating the disease, we may want to favour precision over recall. On the other hand, there may be cases where treating the disease has minor side effects, and leaving the disease untreated has major consequences. In this case we would want to favour recall, where we find as many instances of the disease as possible. This is obviously a complicated subject, and I highly recommend listening to this episode of the podcast linear digressions if you want to know more. . Regression . Now we’ll briefly talk about measuring the performance of regression models. Let’s imagine we have a model which predicts the selling price of a house based on it’s square footage. Here we don’t have a small number of categories (e.g. a house could sell for $503 200 or $632 777). Below I’ve plotted some fake data where the black points show the predicted price, and the blue points show the actual selling price. One way of measuring the amount of error is called Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This is simply adding up all the differences between the predicted and actual values (shown by the red lines) and dividing by the number of points. The absolute part of MAE just means that you take the absolute value of the differences. If you have one prediction which overestimates the price by $5000 and another which underestimates by $5000, the MAE is 10000 (not 0 where the two differences cancel out). A related metric is called Mean Squared Error (MSE) where you square the differences before adding them up. The reason for this that big differences will become even bigger. As an example, a difference of $2 will become 4 but a difference of $1000 will become 1000000. . . Summary . When working on a supervised learning problem, choosing the correct metric is important. First you should think about if you are working on a classification or regression problem. Then you need to consider which metric best measures what you are trying to achieve. This is just a small summary of some of the ways of measuring model performance.

            "content": "In supervised learning, we have labels which tells us the group(s) a data point belongs to. However, in unsupervised learning (where we don’t have labels) we need to calculate how similar points are from one another. To do this we need to have an embedding which consists of two things: . A numeric representation of your data (because we need to do math) | A distance measure (so we can determine how close/far two points are from one another) | Each embedding gives you a different way to look at your data, depending on the features/numeric representation and distance measure you choose. . Let’s solve a mystery . To give you a better idea about what embeddings are, we’re going to look at people hanging out in the Clue mansion. However, instead of solving a murder mystery, we are going to try to determine groups of friends of people in the mansion. . . If I asked you to guess which people (shown as X’s) were most likely to be friends in the image above, you’d probably say the people in the ballroom or lounge. This is because they are physically close together. But how can we say they are “close together”? Implicitly in your head you did this using an embedding. You probably looked at the position of people on the board (i.e their x,y coordinates) so we have a numeric representation of the data. We also know that the people in the ballroom are closer to each other than they are to the person standing outside the billiards room. How do we know this? Imagine drawing a line between the person closest to the piano and the person directly to their left. Now imagine drawing another line between the person closest to the piano, and the person just outside the billiards room. The length of the first line is shorter than the second line, so we say that the two people in the ballroom are closer to each other. This method of measuring distance is called Euclidean distance, and it’s probably what you think of first when you need to determine how close/far something is. However, there are other ways to measure distance. . Distance measures . There are many kinds of distance measures (or metrics) but here are a few popular/useful ones. I’ll also describe some additional distance metrics in a later blog. . Euclidean distance . This is just the length of the line drawn directly between two points as we discussed above. . Manhattan/city block distance . Look at the two people outside the billiards room. If you were playing the game and wanted to move one to the other, you could not move them on a straight line between them. You’d have to move 1 over and then 3 up/down for a total of 4 moves. This is similar to Manhattan (also known as city block) distance, which is the sum of the distances in each direction. In the illustration below, the Manhattan distance between the two points is 12. If you were walking you would need to walk 12 city blocks (assuming you can’t walk through buildings), but there are multiple routes you could take. Manhattan distance is useful for higher dimensional data where Euclidean distance breaks down in what is known as “the curse of dimensionality”. . . Cosine distance/similarity . Another way we can measure distance is by looking at the cosine of the angles between vectors. To make this more concrete, let’s imagine we have some data on how often people spend time in particular rooms in the mansion. .   Billiards room Study Library . Mr. Green | 3 | 0 | 0 | . Ms. Scarlet | 1 | 2 | 2 | . Professor Plum | 0 | 4 | 4 | . In this case, Mr. Green has been in the billiards room 3 times but has never been in the study or library. Looking at these counts we would probably say that Ms. Scarlet and Professor Plum are more similar to each other than they are to Mr. Green. We can think of these counts as vectors in a coordinate system, where instead of an X or a Y axis we have a “Billiards room” or “Study” axis. Below I’ve plotted the vectors below and you can see that the angle between the Ms. Scarlet and Professor Plum vectors is smaller even though the lengths of the vectors are quite different. . . Cosine distance lets us say that two things are similar if they have similar sets of “stuff” even if the frequencies (i.e. vector lengths) are different. If two vectors are pointing in the exact same direction, the angle between them is 0 degrees (even if the length of the vectors are different). The cosine of 0 is 1, so we say they have a cosine similarity of 1. To convert this to a distance, we do 1-similarity since we want the distance between perfectly similar things to be 0. If two things are completely dissimilar, the angle between them is 90 degrees and the cosine similarity is 0. One benefit of cosine similarity is that it takes the direction of the vectors into account, where two vectors pointing in the exact opposite direction will have a similarity of -1. . Changing feature sets . Looking at the physical distance between people in the house is one way to try and determine friend groups. There are other ways that you could measure this. For example you could give everyone a survey about their hobbies/interests. The participants put an X if they are interested in a particular hobby, and leave it blank if they aren’t. This would give you a matrix where a 1 corresponds to a X and a 0 corresponds to a blank: .   Board games Baseball Dancing Cooking . Colonel Mustard | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | . Mrs White | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | . Mrs Peacock | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | . You could then use cosine distance to determine which people have similar interests to one another. This potentially gives you a different view of your data, where the person in the study is (physically) very far from everyone in the first feature set, but could have interests very similar to other people in the second feature set. . Things to keep in mind . All unsupervised machine learning techniques require an embedding. It’s important to think about which feature set/numeric representation and distance metrics you’re using in order to make sure they will help you answer the questions you’re trying to solve. I find it’s helpful to think about “How do I know if two things are similar? What makes them similar?”. . Many techniques implicitly use a certain distance metric (e.g. k-means clustering uses Euclidean distance). You’ll need to make sure that you’re using a technique that allows you to specify a distance metric, or uses one that is correct for your problem. Additionally, you’ll want to make sure that your features are on the same scale (you may need to do some normalization). For example, if you have some data which includes ratings on a 1-5 scale and other ratings on a 1-100 scale, then that will affect your results. Choosing the right embedding requires thinking about your problem, as well as trying out different feature sets and distance metrics. . Other resources .

            "title": "D is for Deep Learning",
            "content": "Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that has exploded in popularity in the past decade. It powers many applications including computer vision, voice assistants, and translating text. While many of these applications might seem like magic, deep learning itself is not magic, and the underlying concepts are fairly easy to understand. The goal of this is to give you a high level overview so I’ll be glossing over some of the nitty-gritty details. . People train and apply deep learning models across a wide variety of problem domains and tasks. One of the most common use cases for deep learning models is classification where you are trying to predict which group of things a piece of data belongs to (e.g. classifying images as a cat or dog). In order to train this model you need to have a label for each image saying that it contains a cat or dog. A machine learning problem where you have labelled data is known as a supervised learning problem. If you don’t have labels then you need to use unsupervised techniques. . Distinguishing between dogs and traffic cones . To make this more concrete let’s use an (admittedly ridiculous) example. Let’s say we have a bunch of pictures, and we want to classify whether the image is of a dog or a traffic cone. This seems pretty simple on the surface because a traffic cone looks nothing like a dog. . . You can probably think of some features that would distinguish these two groups such as: . Is it orange? | Is it cone shaped? | Does it have fur? | This seems pretty clear cut to me. However, if you search a little bit, you can find some examples where the lines start to blur a little bit. . . In one picture, there is orange and in the other there is a cone shape. In both cases however, they are both clearly dogs since they have fur. This means that some features are more/less important than others in being able to distinguish between the two groups (that is they have different weights). . So if we want to be able to effectively predict if an image is of a dog or a traffic cone, we need two things: . Features | A way to weight those features | It is challenging to come up with features and encode them into our program. For example, how would you code “this image has fur in it”? Even if we can code our features, it’s hard to be sure that they are useful in distinguishing between our groups of images. The appeal of deep learning is that it learns both the features and the weights. Typically, there are a large number of features and weights (way more than you would want to come up with manually), which is why things like GPUs are used to train deep learning models. We’ll go through this in more detail in the next section. . How does deep learning actually work? . Deep learning typically refers to large artificial neural network models. A neural network consists of multiple “neurons”. Each circle in the image below is a neuron. The neurons are grouped into layers, classified as input, hidden, or output layers. The “deep” part of deep learning means that there are many hidden layers in the model. . . At a very high level, the input layer derives features from the data that you pass into it. The arrows connecting the layers are referred to as weights. The first hidden layer then receives the features from the input layer, multiplied by the weights between the two layers. If there are multiple hidden layers, then the first layer acts as an input layer for the second layer and so on. Finally, it goes to the output layer where the neural network makes predictions about the input data (e.g. is it a dog or a traffic cone). There is one neuron in the output layer for each class we are trying to predict. We can compare these predictions to their actual labels (e.g. the model predicted the image was a traffic cone but it was actually a dog). Each prediction also has a probability associated with it (e.g. “I am 99% sure this is a dog”). How you actually compare the predicted and actual labels is known as the objective function (sometimes referred to as a cost or loss function). We can use this objective function to update the weights in our model (using something called backpropagation). We repeat this process over and over again until we are satisfied with the model performance. This process is known as “training” a model. . The exact specifics of what makes up the layers is referred to as the network architecture. People generally choose a class of architecture based on the type of problem they are dealing with. For example, if you have image data you will typically choose a class of NNs called convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within that general group of CNNs, people typically use a predefined architecture such as ResNet. If you have text data, you would typically use a class of models called recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or a subcategory of RNNs called long-short term memory networks (LSTMs). . Let’s go back to our dogs versus traffic cones example. If we wanted to train a model to distinguish between those two classes of images, we need to choose a couple of things . A model architecture | An objective function | Since we are dealing with images we will choose some flavour of CNN for our architecture. For the objective function we will choose something called “cross entropy loss”. Cross entropy loss not only measures if the prediction was correct or not but includes how confident the model was. In the case of cross entropy loss a lower number is better. It gives a high value if you are confident and wrong but penalizes you less if you are wrong but less sure about your prediction. Conversely, if you are confident and correct then the value of the loss function will be low. For example, if the model was very confident (e.g. 99% confident) that the picture was a dog but if it was a traffic cone then the value of the loss would be high. . Once we choose an architecture and an objective function, we can train the model. The weights in the model are typically initialized at random. You can also use weights from a pre-trained model (this is known as transfer learning and will be discussed in a later blog). Training uses the labels and objective function to learn/update the weights in order to improve the predictions. I’ll talk about how the weights are actually updated (using something called backpropagation/gradient descent) in a later blog. . You might be wondering “what if there is a picture which contains a dog and a traffic cone?” This is referred to as multi-label classification where you are trying to predict all labels associated with some given input data (e.g. an image). This works in the same way, just with a different objective function. . . Doing this in practice . If you want to learn more about deep learning and have some experience with python, I recommend taking fast.ai’s practical deep learning for coders course. It uses a “top-down” approach in which you learn to build and train models first, learning about each component as you need to. . If you actually want to implement a deep learning model, you should use an existing framework. Some popular python frameworks are: . Tensorflow | Pytorch | Keras | Fastai | . Other resources .

            "title": "C is for Clustering",
            "content": "Clustering is useful when you want to find groups of related items. For example, these items could be documents, malware samples, or customers. Clustering is also referred to as unsupervised learning since it does not involve labelled data. High quality labelled data is often hard to get, so clustering is often a good method to analyze your data. We often use clustering methods (along with visualization) when doing exploratory data analysis (EDA) since it allows us to understand how the data clumps together. . What else can you use clustering for? . Anomaly/outlier detection . Since you know which group an object belongs to, you can say “show me the items which don’t belong to a group”. You can also look for points on the outer edges of clusters since they may also be anomalous. . Labelling points . You can even use clustering to help you label your data! Instead of labelling 100 images as dogs/cats individually, you could have groups of images which are much easier to label (i.e. “here are 24 dogs all grouped together”). . . How do you actually cluster points together? . Take a look at the image below (courtesy of Leland Mcinnes). You can probably see which points should be grouped together but some points clearly look like they don’t belong to any groups. . . The simple definition of clustering “find similar groups of stuff” sounds fairly simple at the surface. If you think about it a bit more you’ll realize that there are a number of questions that need to be answered: . How do you define similarity? In every clustering algorithm you need to specify a way of measuring the distance between two points. This is often referred to as a distance metric. As you would expect, points are similar if they are close together (the distance between them is small) and less similar the farther apart they are. There are many kinds of distance metrics, which I will touch on in later blog posts. | Does every point need to belong to a group? Can a point belong to multiple groups? The answers to these questions depend on the algorithm. In some cases, points can only belong to one group. This is known as hard clustering. In other cases they have a probability associated with being part of a cluster. This is known as soft clustering (or fuzzy clustering). Some clustering algorithms will force every point into a group (whether it belongs in there or not), while others will just label those points as outliers/noise. | Types of clustering methods . Since the definition of cluster is so broad, there are many types of clustering algorithms. Here are a few broad categories: . Centroid based . In these algorithms, clusters are determined based on which centroid you are closest to. A centroid is just a point calculated by averaging all of the other points in a group. One popular centroid based method is k-means which works as follows. . Pick k centroids (where k is the number of clusters in your data). For the sake of argument, let’s say we have 2 centroids. | Randomly place the centroids | Calculate the distance from each point to the centroid, and pick the closest centroid as its cluster id. For example if a point is closest to centroid 1 then it is part of cluster 1 | Recalculate the centroids as the average of all of the points in the cluster. Centroid 1 is now the average of all points in cluster 1, centroid 2 the average of all points in cluster 2, etc. | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until your clusters stabilize (i.e. the cluster ids for your points stop changing) | . There are a few issues with this method. The first is that it is really hard to know how many clusters you have ahead of time (i.e it’s hard to choose k). The second is that it doesn’t allow for clusters of different shapes since it assumes that all clusters are spherical. Finally, every point is forced into a cluster. . Density based . In density based clustering algorithms, clusters are areas with lots of points. If you look at the image above, this probably closely aligns with your intuition about what is/is not in a cluster. The clusters you identified have high density (lots of points in a small area). DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) is a popular density based clustering algorithm. It has two main parameters, min_points and epsilon. In order for something to be labelled a cluster, there must be at least min_points close together. If min_points is 10, that means there will be no clusters with less than 10 data points. Epsilon is basically “how far from a point do I look to see if it is close”. For each point, you can see how many other points are within epsilon. If there are at least min_points, then you have a cluster. In the image below, all of the red points (A) have at least 4 points (min_points=4) within epsilon distance. The yellow points (B and C) are also in the cluster because they are reachable from one of the red points. N would be labelled an outlier since it is not within epsilon of any points. . . Choosing min_points is much easier than choosing the number of clusters ahead of time (which we needed to do in k-means). However, picking the correct value for epsilon can be tricky and is more of an art than a science. Another issue with DBSCAN is that it assumes all of the clusters have the same density, which is not always the case. . Distribution based . In these algorithms, you train sets of statistical models and points are assigned to a cluster based on which model they are most likely to occur in. One benefit of this type of algorithm is each point has a probability associated with belonging (e.g. 0.75 probability of being in cluster A, and a 0.25 probability of being in cluster B). This means soft clustering is baked into the algorithm, and if you want hard clusters (i.e. a point can only belong to one cluster) you can just choose the largest likelihood. One popular algorithm in this class is Gaussian Mixture Models, where you start with a set of randomly initialized Gaussian models and then update their parameters based on your data. Learning these parameters is done using an interative method called [expectation-maximization algorithm(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm). One downside of these types of models is that they may overfit your data. That is the model will fit your data very well but not generalize well to new data. . Connectivity based . Connectivity based clustering is also known as hierarchical clustering. One of the core ideas is that things can be grouped together at different levels. For example a picture of a golden retriever could be grouped with other retriever breeds, all dogs, common pets, all animals, etc. In this case other pictures of retrievers would be close, other dogs slightly further away, and then other animals further away from that. This creates a dendrogram (tree) and the clusters are determined by where you cut in the tree. For example in the figure if you cut at the first branch, you would have two clusters: one containing lemurs, and the other containing all of the pictures of cats/dogs. Cutting at the next branch down you would have three clusters: lemurs, cats, and all dogs. . . There are basically two ways to create this dendrogram. The first is a bottom up approach where every point starts as its own cluster and then you merge clusters together. In the second method everything starts as its own cluster and then you iteratively break everything apart until each point is it’s own cluster. The difference between algorithms in this class basically differ on how you choose to measure the distance between clusters. . How do I choose which clustering (or class of) algorithm to use? . Some of this depends on your data. In practice many algorithms combine elements of these classes. One example of this is HDBSCAN (hierarchical DBSCAN), which is an extremely useful clustering algorithm. I’ll talk about HDBSCAN in more detail in a future blog post but HDBSCAN is a good first choice.

            "title": "B is for Bias",
            "content": "The term bias is used in a few different contexts within data science. When people mention bias they are typically referring to either the “bias-variance tradeoff” or “unjust bias”. I’ll primarily talk about unjust bias in this blog and will talk about tuning models/measuring model performance in later blogs. . Bias-variance tradeoff . The bias-variance tradeoff refers to tuning models such that they don’t under/overfit your data. A model has high bias if it underfits the training set (e.g. if you are trying to fit a line to non-linear data). A model has high variance if it overfits the training set (i.e. doesn’t generalize well). This could occur if you have a huge non-linear function with a large number of parameters. The bias-variance tradeoff is trying to find a model that minimizes both of these phenomena. . Unjust bias and the importance of having a human in the loop . Machine learning models are useful for helping humans sort through large piles of data. However, it is critical to have a human in the loop in order to validate predictions. It’s particularly important when ML models are used to predict things like university admissions or welfare benefits which have a huge impact on people’s lives. As we talked about in the previous blog, there are two key points to always keep in mind about AI/ML . It’s not magic | It’s not perfect | Problems arise when people treat the output of ML models as completely objective (or magic) with no opportunities to overrule these predictions. . Bias refers to a model that is prejudiced in favour of particular categories. Unjust bias occurs when there is a mismatch between the models view of the world and how we think the world should be. There are many reasons that this can happen but two of the big ones are: . The training data is not truly representative. It may favour certain categories over others leading to better predictions on those categories. As the saying goes: “garbage in, garbage out”. | The training data is truly representative of past behaviour. However, this might be different than what we want the future behaviour to be. | There are a couple of famous examples of biased models which demonstrate this behaviour. . Facial recognition . Facial recognition tools are increasingly being utilized by organizations such as law enforcement agencies. Model fairness is critical in this case since if a model is biased against particular subgroups it will have a disproportionate impact on the lives of people in that subgroup. Researchers studied 3 commercially available facial recognition tools from Microsoft, IBM, and FACE++ (study is here). The researchers found that the models performed much better on men and also had higher accuracy on lighter skinned people. In the worst case there was a 34.4% difference in accuracy between lighter skinned men compared to darker skinned women. This shows when the training data does not accurately represent all subgroups the result is a biased model. . . Amazon’s hiring model . Like many companies, Amazon receives huge numbers of applicants and sorting through these applications is incredibly time intensive. They had a historical set of applications and know which of those candidates were hired. So, they developed a machine learning model to sort through the applications and rank the candidates in terms of their likelihood to be hired. However, this essentially turned into a gender detection model since the vast majority of their previous hires were men. For example, the model would penalize resumes which included the word “women’s”. This is a case where a model can make accurate predictions based on historical data, however this does not match with how hiring should be done. Despite the fact that Amazon scrapped this model, they are far from the only company who would like to automate portions of their hiring process. Creating a fair and unbiased method of doing so that is interpretable is still an open research question. You should be suspicious of anyone who claims to have solved this problem. . . How can we fix this? . It is important to note that humans are also biased. They can grade using different criteria if they get grumpy or tired. The appeal of using ML models is that they are much cheaper than humans and can scale much better. If left unchecked, this just means that biased decisions are made at a much larger scale than what was done previously. The best approach is to use a mixture of ML models while keeping a human in the loop. This means providing a way for people to appeal decisions made by an ML model (such as university/college admissions) and allowing a human to override the decision. As researchers, something to keep in mind is that the users of these algorithms may not understand probabilities/confidence intervals. Even if they do understand these concepts they may not feel comfortable overruling the ML model. . Creating models that are fair and interpretable is still an active area of research. This is an incredibly complex and nuanced topic but it is important to be aware of it. Later on, I will write a blog about the different techniques you can use to interpret ML models to try and gain insight into how they are making decisions. . Other resources .

            "title": "A is for Artificial Intelligence",
            "content": "I was recently in San Francisco and throughout the city there are many, many billboards containing slogans like “Mission Critical AI” and “Enterprise AI”. There is no doubt that usage of the phrase “artificial intelligence” or AI has increased dramatically in recent years. This increased usage has made it difficult to tell what “using AI” even means. . So what is AI? . Many people have differing opinions on how to strictly define AI. When people refer to AI this is generally synonymous with machine learning (ML). Since it’s so hard to come up with a definition, let’s define what AI is not: . AI is not magic | AI is not perfect (more on that in B is for Bias) | . It’s hard to come up with a strict definition for AI since the generally agreed upon definition has evolved over time. In the 1980s people called large rule based systems (“expert systems”) AI. These systems required subject matter experts and programmers to define a set of rules. As you can imagine (or remember) this is a very time intensive process and there are lots of edge cases to consider. Nowadays people typically think of deep learning (more on that in D is for Deep Learning) as AI. This requires lots of labeled training data (which often needs to be labeled by experts) but models can learn their own rules about the data. . In both cases the “intelligence” part of AI is a bit of a misnomer. Another term that has been suggested is “cognitive automation”. We are trying to teach a machine to perform a set of tasks based on our knowledge of the world. This is different from something that is truly intelligent that can reason about the world and learn abstract concepts. This distinction is important and referred to as “general” versus “narrow” AI. . General AI (also referred to as strong AI) refers to a machine that is “human-like” (think HAL 9000 or Skynet). As you would expect from the name, it can generalize it’s previous knowledge to new problem domains. This means that It can intelligently perform a wide variety of tasks without needing explicit training data. Voice assistants like Alexa, and Siri seem like they can generalize, but as anyone who has used them knows, they definitely have limits. They tend not to understand context in a way that a human would, and questions may need to be rephrased in order to be interpreted correctly. A true general AI doesn’t currently exist and it will probably be a while before it does. . Narrow AI (or weak AI) refers to a machine that is good at specific tasks (e.g. image recognition) but can’t generalize to different domains. For example, you could train a machine learning model to distinguish between cats and dogs but it would not be able to answer the question “Where is the best pizza in Ottawa?”. Narrow AI works by using predefined rules or learning from lots of (probably labelled) data. . What is AI used for? . AI/ML is widely used in a large variety of industries for a number of tasks. This includes: . Recommending videos on youtube | Detecting if a computer has malware | Financial trading | Helping doctors make diagnoses | Voice assistants like Google Assistant | . Many of these tasks are applications of fields such as: . Computer vision (processing images and audio) | Natural Language Processing (NLP) | Recommender systems | . The fact that AI is a buzzword means that it is applied to many different products (even if they don’t include any ML models). This over usage of the term causes many people to twitch when they hear it (and judge people who do use the term). However, it’s important to keep in mind your audience when you are talking about machine learning. Some audiences may not be familiar with specific technical terms (point them at this blog series ;) ) but have heard the term AI. . Summary . AI/ML is a rapidly growing field which is being applied to a large variety of domains. It’s hard to separate what is real from the snake oil. I’m hoping this blog series will give you enough background knowledge to think critically when you hear the term AI and know the limitations of AI/ML models. In the next blog I’ll talk about many of these limitations and how they affect people’s everyday lives. . Other resources . Crash Course Artificial Intelligence | Hello World - Hannah Fry | .",
